Imagine we have a browser{can be chrome , Microsoft edge,}

What is browser: a software by which we can ineract with information on the WWW

and Browser has window(Small w) object that controls the functionality of browser  

why it's an object: cause in browser every functionality stored in key value pairs and the name of object is Window like: 
const window = {
 alert
 <!-- We don't call it we just give refrence -->
 ,console
}
and we can get the value by window.alert()

Document Object Model(DOM): Displays HTML contnet as object that is present on the browser it is represent as tree structure
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
  <title>About elk</title>
</head>
<body>
  The truth about elk.
</body>

every tag is node{branch} and every node has it's own property such HEAD,TITLE,BODY

innerHTML="It works only for elments inside body{including it} tag"



// document.body.innerHTML='Hello'

/*document: Entire HTML code 
Body: content inside body of HTML code 
innerHTML: property of HTML elments that say write it on that HTML elments

so it will write on body{window} = Hello



yeah we have windows as top but window is by default lag hi jata hai document ke saath so don't need to write window */
