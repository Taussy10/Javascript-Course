// //Everything happens inside an Execution context{box} 


// single threaded: code executed one at a time 
// synchronous: sync: together , choronous: time = execute with same time

// js is synchronous single threaded language: Which means js one block of code execute on at a time in a specific order{when one line finishes then 2nd line execute}

// AJAX:
// // BTW you can make js asynchronous: when we call API thenw e don't know when will get data from API so we make it Async so that when Data comes code execute{code doesn't execute with the time}
