    <h1>hello</h1>

Computer understands binary languages and we write programming language 
having english language words so we need to convert them to make sure 
computer understands it  and we do it by using compiler and interpeter  

Imagine a code haiving 10 lines
Then compiler 
1. Takes all code in one go 
2. converts all codes to machine readable language{binary} 
4. Executes it 
5. Shows output then computers.

Imagine a code having 10 lines
Then interpeter 
1. Takes one line at a time  
2. converts one line to machine readable language{binary} 
4. Executes it 
5. Shows output then computers.
6. Repeats for the 2nd line.

What if code has a mistake
Compiler: won't execute the code.
Interpeter: if a line has a problem won't execute line that is gonna come

Compiler: fast because it compiles code into groups
Interpeter: It's slow because it executes code line by line 

programming languages example:
Compiler: C , C++
Interpeter: Python
 
Compiler + Interpeter: Javascript
