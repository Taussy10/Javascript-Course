    What are data types 🤔
    👉Data types tells what type of things can be contained by container(variables)

    Two types of dataType
    1. Primitive : only single values can be stored
    2. Non-Primitive : collection of values that can stored: objects


    Red here: https://javascript.info/types



👉 There are 8 Primitive data type in js 

👉 1.number: mathematical Numbers such as 1,-5,6
e.g. const age = 15

👉 2.string: 
e.g. const name = "John"

Strings in js can be written in 3 types
👉 1. 'single quotes' 
👉 2. "double quotes"
👉 3. `backticks`


👉 3.null = 0: empty value
e.g. const age = null

👉 4.undefined: value is not assigned.
e.g. const age = undefined; 

👉 5. NaN: Not a number.
e.g. const age = 19+w 

👉 6.Boolean: True = 1 or False = 0.

👉7. Big int : for greater than or less than   ±(2⁵³ -1)

 (2⁵³ -1) it's a greatest value that an integer can contains

(2⁵³ -1) it's a least  value that an integer can contains 

const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;

Here n specifies that it's a big int


👉8. Symbol: used to create unique identifiers.

const symbol1 = Symbol("Javascript")
const symbol2 = Symbol("Javascript")

Symbol !== Symbol2


Non-Primitive dataType
1. Object: const = {
    a: "Hello",
    b: 85,
}


 typeof operator: To get data type of value
 
i.e. 
1. typeof 5 = number
2. typeof "Hello" = Strings
3. typeof null = object {it's a JS Bug }
4. typeof NaN = number {it's a historical mistake}
5. typeof undefined = undefined 
6. typeof Boolean = function 
7. typeof BigInt = function 
8. typeof symbol = function 
9. typeof object = function 



By the way string is more powerful than numbers because 

'hell'+3 = hello3 
Because 3 has converted in strings


Javascript is dynamically typed language: 
let c = 4;
c = "Changed"
variable aren't bound to one dataType they can change

JS supports infinity
const a = 1/0
console.log(a); = infinity
